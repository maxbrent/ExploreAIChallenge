# Explore AI Challenge

- For the Explore AI challenge I have chosen to prepare a notebook to teach **Data Science end-to-end**
- This is an attempt to cover all of the Data Science techniques that I have acquired over the years within the 4 days that I have been issued this challenge.
- **For future use the following content will be added:**
  - Evaluating Model Performance with Multiple Metrics(TP, TN, FP, FN, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC, ROC)
  - Scaling our Models to Production in Google Cloud Platform
  - Advanced Statistics such as Gaussian Processes, Multivariate Distributions, Likelihood, Out-of-Distribution models, etc.

### **NB: If I had made any errors along the way with the documentation in the notebook, please excuse this as I shall update any errors at a later time in the future**

## Instructions to Run Notebook

1. Open the following link in a new tab: [Data Science End-to-End](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maxbrent/ExploreAIChallenge/blob/master/Explore_AI_Challenge.ipynb)

2. Next click on "Sign IN" on the top right corner and sign in with your standard google user credentials

3. Once signed in click on the "Connect" button on the top right corner and wait for the environment to initialize, once the runtime environment is initialized, you will see a "Connected" with a tick in the top right corner.

4. You are now able to run the each of the code cells. To run the code cells use **"Shift + Enter"**
