# ExploreAIChallenge

- For the Explore AI challenge I have chosen to prepare a notebook to teach **Data Science end-to-end**
- This is an attempt to cover all of the Data Science techniques that I have acquired over the years within the 4 days that I have been issued this challenge.
- **For future use the following content will be added:**
  - Evaluating Model Performance with Multiple Metrics(TP, TN, FP, FN, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC, ROC)
  - Scaling our Models to Production in Google Cloud Platform
  - Advanced Statistics such as Gaussian Processes, Multivariate Distributions, Likelihood, Out-of-Distribution models, etc.

**NB: If I had made any errors along the way with the documentation in the notebook, please excuse this as I shall update any errors at a later time in the future**
